> ## List of awesome things about semantic segmentation :tada: 

Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task in which we label specific regions of an image according to what's being shown. Semantic segmentation awswers for the question: "What's in this image, and where in the image is it located?".

Semantic segmentation is a critical module in robotics related applications, especially autonomous driving, remote sensing. Most of the research on semantic segmentation is focused on improving the accuracy with less attention paid to computationally efficient solutions
